							<h1>Analyzing Game Reviews with MongoDB</h1>
                            <h3>Scraping and integrating review data from Steam and Metacritic to analyze how reviews impact game popularity.</h3>
						</header>
						<p>This project was written in collaboration with Paolo Caggiano for the Data Management course in the Master's Degree in Data Science. <br>
                            The project is interested in addressing different questions related to the rapidly growing videogame market:
                            Are professional critics' reviews the main factor of a game's success? Or, as the game community is strictly bound to the internet, other users' reviews are what count the most?
                            How important are the reviews in terms of success or failure of a game?
                            Are there genres more attractive than others in terms of reviews? <br>
                            <br>
                            To answer these questions, we <strong>scraped</strong> data from both Steam and Metacritic, and then stored them in a MongoDb database.
                            From the latter we took all the steps necessary to clean and integrate the data of the two different sources. <br>
                            <br>
                            The project therefore showcases our ability to carry out a data science project from the <strong>acquisition</strong> phase, through the <strong>storing</strong>, <strong>cleaning</strong> and <strong>integration</strong> of the data, to the final <strong>exploratory analysis</strong> and <strong>conclusion drawing</strong> phases.
                            It also demonstrates our abilities to make <strong>decisions</strong> throughout all of the stages based on the type of data and the type of analysis we wanted to carry out.
                            All this was achieved through the use of languages like <strong>Python</strong> and platforms like <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>. <br>
                            <br> 
                            Further information about the decisions we made for the acquisition, storing and integration of the data can be read on the official <strong>report</strong>.</p>
