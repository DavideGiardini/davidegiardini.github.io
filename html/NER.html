							<h1>Named Entity Recognition and Linking</h1>
							<h3>Extracting and linking entities to Wikipedia using spaCy and transformer-based BLINK models.</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							This assignment was developed for the <strong>Data Semantics</strong> course in the Masterâ€™s Degree in Data Science.<br><br>

							The goal was to apply a <strong>spaCy Named Entity Recognition</strong> pipeline to a text assigned individually to each student. We were then asked to evaluate the extracted spans by comparing them with a gold standard, using different matching criteria.<br><br>

							Similar metrics were computed to assess the correctness of the predicted entity types (such as person, location, organization, date, etc.). We also performed a qualitative error analysis of the span and type predictions.<br><br>

							In the second part of the assignment, we linked the identified entities to their corresponding <strong>Wikipedia pages</strong> using three approaches:
							<ul>
								<li>A naive string-matching method</li>
								<li>A bi-encoder version of the BLINK model</li>
								<li>The full BLINK model with both bi-encoder and cross-encoder</li>
							</ul>
							After evaluating the linking accuracy with appropriate metrics, we also performed a qualitative analysis of the results.<br><br>

							The results showed a clear performance advantage of the two BLINK-based approaches over the naive method. Some cases were particularly insightful. For example, when linking the phrase <strong>"Foreign Ministry"</strong>:
							<ol>
								<li>The naive method linked it to the general "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" page.</li>
								<li>The bi-encoder approach tried to disambiguate it based on context but incorrectly linked it to "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Taiwan)", likely influenced by the nearby mention of "Taiwan".</li>
								<li>The full BLINK model correctly linked it to "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China", showing its superior contextual understanding.</li>
							</ol>

							An even more interesting case occurred with the entity <strong>"Tang Shubei"</strong>:
							<ul>
								<li>Both BLINK approaches incorrectly linked him to "Tang Fei", a different person.</li>
								<li>Surprisingly, the naive method linked him to the "Qiandao Lake incident" page. Although this is technically incorrect (it links a person to an event), Tang Shubei is actually mentioned in that article as the ARATS vice president. So, in a way, the naive approach surfaced the only Wikipedia page that references him.</li>
							</ul>
