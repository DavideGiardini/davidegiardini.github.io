							<h1>Dynamic Portfolio Optimization</h1>
							<h3>Building and backtesting stock portfolios using 40+ financial indicators, screening models, and time-series forecasting.</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							This project was developed in collaboration with Vittorio Haardt and Alberto Formigoni for the Financial Markets Analytics course in the Master’s Degree in Data Science.<br><br>
							
							The goal of the project was to utilize a broad set of <strong>key financial indicators</strong> from multiple companies to construct a portfolio with the highest expected returns.<br>
							More than 40 indicators were used, including: <strong>PE ratio, EBITDA, sales and debt per share, stock price and its moving averages, volatility, return on equity, price-to-book ratio</strong>, and others.
							This wide range of metrics also demonstrates our strong understanding of both fundamental and technical indicators.<br><br>

							In the initial phase, we built all the tools necessary for our analysis.<br>
							After a preliminary data cleaning phase, we constructed a benchmark to later compare all portfolio strategies against.<br>
							A <strong>custom Python function</strong> was then implemented to simulate a screening model: this function made monthly decisions on which stocks to buy or sell, based on companies’ indicators.
							It also computed the monthly portfolio value by taking into account both the buy/sell operations and price movements.<br>
							This screening function was reused, sometimes with minor modifications, throughout the project to evaluate different screening strategies.<br><br>

							We also developed additional functions to compute several key performance metrics for each portfolio: <strong>Sharpe ratio</strong>, <strong>Sortino ratio</strong>, and <strong>Information ratio</strong>.<br><br>

							Once all analytical tools were in place, we implemented various screening strategies and compared their performance.<br>
							These included <strong>Sequential Screening</strong>, <strong>Simultaneous Screening</strong>, and an approach that <strong>accounts for correlations between factors</strong>.<br>
							We also designed a <strong>Volatility-Weighted Portfolio</strong> and a <strong>Momentum-Based Portfolio</strong>.<br><br>

							For the final part of the project, we explored the use of <strong>Deep Learning</strong> for portfolio construction. We selected <strong>Prophet</strong>, a time-series forecasting model developed by Meta, to predict future stock prices and guide investment decisions.<br><br>

							The project achieved outstanding results and demonstrated the practical application of advanced financial analysis and machine learning techniques in portfolio optimization.
