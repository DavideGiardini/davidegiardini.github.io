							<h1>Bachelor Thesis Project</h1>
							<h3>Evaluating the effectiveness of Twitter Sentiment Analysis as a predictive tool for the stock market.</h3>
						</header>

						<p>
							<h4>Aim</h4>
							The goal of this thesis was to build a time series representing the sentiment polarity of tweets related to a selected group of companies, and compare it to the corresponding time series of their stock market behavior.<br><br>
							The selected companies were: Apple, Google, Nike, Nestlé, Beyond Meat, Bayer, and NovaVax.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h4>Data Acquisition</h4>
							I collected tweets using Twitter's API, writing all the code in R. I automated the data collection process using Windows Task Scheduler, ensuring that tweets were downloaded daily at the same time.<br><br>
							The downloaded data was automatically uploaded to OneDrive for remote access. Additionally, I implemented an automated email notification system via Gmail that confirmed the successful execution of the download and included basic statistics about the collected data.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h4>Sentiment Analysis</h4>
							I preprocessed the data by cleaning and lemmatizing the tweets, and then applied three sentiment analysis methods to compute a polarity score for each tweet:
							<ol>
								<li>
									<strong>Naive Bayes</strong><br>
									Based on Bayes’ Theorem, this classifier labeled tweets as "positive" or "negative" using the 
									<a href="https://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/">MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon</a> by Janyce Wiebe.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Syuzhet</strong><br>
									Used the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/syuzhet.pdf">Syuzhet R package</a> and its associated dictionary to assign sentiment scores.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Udpipe</strong><br>
									Applied the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/udpipe/udpipe.pdf">Udpipe R package</a> with the MPQA lexicon. This method supports intensifiers, weakeners, and modifiers, enabling it to differentiate between phrases like "good", "very good", "quite good", and "not good".
								</li>
							</ol>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h4>Conclusion</h4>
							To evaluate whether a causal relationship exists between tweet sentiment and a company’s stock price, I developed a custom test based on the Granger Causality Test, which I named the 
							<a href="Close Test.html">Close Test</a>. The results were promising, revealing several statistically significant causal relationships.<br><br>

							Interestingly, the test found that:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Tweets specifically referencing a company’s stock symbol (e.g., $AAPL, $GOOGL), referred to as the "stock" dataset, were more useful for short-term predictions (same-day closing price).
								</li>
								<li>
									Tweets mentioning the company name more generally (e.g., Apple, Google), referred to as the "score" dataset, were better suited for forecasting stock behavior over the following days.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<p>
							A more detailed analysis of the visualizations and findings can be accessed in the final report or by visiting the corresponding GitHub repository.
