							<h2>My story</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I've always been curious, since I can remember. As a kid, every answer for me was priceless, a beautiful insight of a world that never ceased to amaze me, and brought light to other fields that I wanted to know more of. I got to the point where I didn't know where to go next: thousands of doors to open, but only one to choose, a multitude of disciplines to grasp, but only one to master.</p>
						<p class="quote">	For me learning statistics was not just about opening a door, but more about learning the tools to open them all.</p>
						<p> For me analyzing data means being able to satisfy all the curiosity I bring with me since I was a kid, because it doesn't constrain you to only one topic, as its methods are applicable to all the subjects in the world.<br>
							The power of statistics was for me evident from the start, but only after a year I gained a true perspective on the amount of data that I could work with, and I was stunned. I felt powerful, because I had both the tools to extract knowledge from numbers and all the numbers I could think of.<br />
							While writing new scripts, I founded in programming the same excitement I felt for statistics, as it is such a broad subject that one constantly has to learn new skills and face new problems.</p>
